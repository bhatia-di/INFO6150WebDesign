Assign 2 - Problem Statement

Create your own professional portfolio website and add the contents accordingly. Here below are the additional guidelines:

1	Use an external CSS file 

I have created two external files named: imagegallery.css and index.css 
I have imported the same in the index.html file
This creates a logical seperation between css properties based on generic versus component level usage


2	Use of float/overflow property

I have used float:right to align the navbar towards the right of the navigation panel

3	Use of column layout structure

4	use of absolute/relative position whenever necessary.

5	use of tel, mailto option for contact information 

6	If you add any table then style the table using CSS selectors. Guide for CSS Selectors - http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp

7	Create a professional  image gallery for certifications etc. with hover effects and figure captions. Include this in your portfolio.

8	Use the html and  html5 elements throughout. 

9	Make the website responsive using media queries for devices like IPad(768px) and Smart phones (350 â€“ 365px). For example, below pic is a sample. 

10	Use your own creativity and there would be 10 bonus point so document the creativity while submit the assignment so we can evaluate. f or 10 bonus point need to be creative and explain and justify in readme.txt file and also while giving the demo


11	Include the readme.txt and include all the tags used. 

12	For this assignment you need to have very good UI(rich UI) as this will be considered while grading.
