Assign 2 - Problem Statement

Create your own professional portfolio website and add the contents accordingly. Here below are the additional guidelines:

1	Use an external CSS file 

I have created two external files named: imagegallery.css and index.css 
I have imported the same in the index.html file
This creates a logical seperation between css properties based on generic versus component level usage


2	Use of float/overflow property

I have used float:right to align the navbar towards the right of the navigation panel

3	Use of column layout structure

I have used column layout structure in the about me section.
I set the below property to create a divider among the text.
column-count: 2;
column-rule: 0.5px solid lightgray;



4	use of absolute/relative position whenever necessary.

Added position relative to flex div in the column direction for image gallery.
Added position absolute proprtyinside the text to show it at the right location


5	use of tel, mailto option for contact information 
In the contact me section, I have used both attributes and user can email me if they want to contact me.


6	If you add any table then style the table using CSS selectors. Guide for CSS Selectors - http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp

I have used a lot of selectors. For example,
#id
.css_classname
:hover

7	Create a professional  image gallery for certifications etc. with hover effects and figure captions. Include this in your portfolio.

8	Use the html and  html5 elements throughout. 

9	Make the website responsive using media queries for devices like IPad(768px) and Smart phones (350 â€“ 365px). For example, below pic is a sample. 

I have added media queries to make the images responsive.


10	Use your own creativity and there would be 10 bonus point so document the creativity while submit the assignment so we can evaluate. f or 10 bonus point need to be creative and explain and justify in readme.txt file and also while giving the demo

I think I have depicted my creativity with chossing the right color theme and also adopting to right practices.
I have added pictures and used the <img> tag to my benefit and made the website more reactive and responsive by adding 
interactions that catch the eye.

1. Resume Button Css interaction
2. Skills Sliders 
3. Hover effects in the skills section
4. Linear Gradient in the Skills section
5. Trasitions throught the webpage

11	Include the readme.txt and include all the tags used. 
<nav>
<img>
<p>
<a>
<h1>, <h6>
<br>
<span>
<footer>
<section>
<hr>


12	For this assignment you need to have very good UI(rich UI) as this will be considered while grading.
